Questions?

-What is the PiggibotBot?
The Piggibot is a bot run by a script which supervises the room. The Bot is able to automatically skip songs that are too long or place people back into the queue after they disconnect and respond to commands such as !dc and !eta. The Bot doesn't moderate the room, we have staff to do that.

-What can I do if I disconnect?
Well, if you reconnect, the bot is likely to recognise that you were a previous position and therefore move you back. you can !dc. 

-How can I make my character dance?
In order for your character to dance, two things can be done. Firstly, wooting the song will make your character dance. Or when playing a song, your character will dance with its back to you.

-How do I change my status to something besides available?
Statuses are able to be changed by clicking on your avatar preview in the bottom right hand corner. Once the menu is open, there will be options to be "Away, Gaming and Working" statuses to use.

-How do I join a waitlist?
You're able to join the queue as indicated in the bottom left hand corner button that says "Join". If the queue is full, it will state that it is full and you cannot enter.

-How do I create a playlist?
The large bar at the bottom is a menu of all playlists. Click on it and then go to the "Create" button in the bottom left-hand side and choose a name for the playlist.

-How do I level up?
To level up, there's a certain amount of experience required. With each level, the higher the requirement and ultimately more time is spent on plug.dj.

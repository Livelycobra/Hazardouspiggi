#Rules and Etiquette For Plug.dj.

• We allow all music genres under 8 minutes, even mixes/mashups! However, we focus more on EDM music and we want actual music, no parodies.

• We allow swearing, but you cannot use it to disrespect others or use racism/stereotypes. Pornography is restricted from here as well, so is anything 18+. Just have the parts covered up. ;)

• Repeating a song in the history is prohibited.

• We do not allow requests of fans, skips, mehs, songs, and woots. We pick what we please.

• Having more mehs than woots for 10 seconds would result in a song skip.

• It is suggested that you would not meh a song instantly. Give it some time. If you don’t like it, you may freely meh the song.

• No advertisements of other places or communities.

• Enjoy your experiences! We do appreciate new ideas into the community.
